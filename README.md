# ReAuto

ReAuto is a PROS library for quick autonomous programming. It was developed by team 727G during the 2022-2023 VRC season Spin Up.

**Documentation coming soon! :)**

*edit as of 2023-10-23: ReAuto now supports path.jerryio path gen!*
*Make a path and then drop it onto your SD card to use it.*

*note: when using https://path.jerryio.com/ ensure you've selected the option for LemLib compatibility*

# EDIT: As of 11/11/23, ReAuto has unfortunately been cancelled. Despite all the work put in, a bug which causes autonomous code to not work in matches is simply unfixable :(
